# HamsterIsland
Development for the Hamster Island browser game

Hamster Island is a vanilla JavaScript based idle game
===
In the game you are given a single hamster that, by clicking, produces more hamsters.

After generating enough hamsters, you will be able to buy upgrades that..
- ..increase your hamsters generated per click.
- ..increase automatic hamster generation.
- ..increase the number of hamsters your current island can hold.
- ..

After buying every available upgrade in the current world, you can go to the next one and unlock even more upgrades.

Also, after increasing your automatically generated hamsters, rare hamsters will start to appear that will gift
you more hamsters or boost your current hamsters per second ratio.
